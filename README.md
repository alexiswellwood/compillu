The files [wphp-JoS-accept-sentences.csv](wphp-JoS-accept-sentences.csv) and [wphp-JoS-recall-sentences.csv](wphp-JoS-recall-sentences.csv) list the sentences used in our reported Experiments 1-3, as well as in our three preliminary experiments. The latter, Experiments 1a-c, are described in the document [wphp-JoS-report-prelim-expts.pdf](wphp-JoS-report-prelim-expts.pdf), rather than in the *JoS* paper.

The document [wphp-JoS-appendices.pdf](wphp-JoS-appendices.pdf) provides additional information related to our experimental set-up. These appendices are included in the *Journal of Semantics* paper, and provided here simply for ease of reference.
