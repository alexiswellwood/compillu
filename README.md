Files for the paper "Anatomy of a comparative illusion"

The files wphp-JoS-accept-sentences.csv and wphp-JoS-recall-sentences.csv list the sentences used in our Experiments 1-3 reported in our accepted *Journal of Semantics* paper, as well as in our three preliminary experiments, themselves reported in wphp-JoS-report-prelim-expts.pdf. 

The document wphp-JoS-appendices.pdf provides additional information related to these experiments. These appendices are included in the *Journal of Semantics* paper, but are included here for ease of reference.
